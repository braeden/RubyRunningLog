# Ruby Running Log

Assignment for Ruby Programming Class

Needs Linux to Run or code needs to be changed

Objective: Create a program called running.rb that does the following:

Asks the user for how far he or she ran today and how long it took to run. The user should enter the distance in miles and the time in hours and minutes. 
Store this information into a text file(s) on the computer. The file should be opened in append mode so old running distances and times are not erased when new ones are recorded. Or you may consider opening it in r+ mode so that it can first be read and then written to. That is, the file will keep growing by one line (for the new run entry) each time the user runs the program.
Before finishing, the program tells the user the cumulative distance run for all run entries and computes the average pace (average minutes per mile) for all runs.
